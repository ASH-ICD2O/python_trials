## Python Assignment: Pizza Ordering System

### Objective:
Create a program that simulates a pizza ordering system. The program should allow the user to choose a pizza size and calculate the total cost based on the selected size.

### Instructions:
1. **Input**: Prompt the user to enter their name and choose a pizza size (small, medium, or large).
2. **Variables**: Store the user's name, chosen pizza size, and the corresponding price in variables.
3. **Conditional Statements**: Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to determine the price based on the chosen pizza size.
4. **Output**: Print a message with the user's name, chosen pizza size, and the total cost.

### Requirements:
1. The program should display a menu with the following pizza sizes and prices:
   - Small: $8.00
   - Medium: $10.00
   - Large: $12.00
2. The user should be able to select a pizza size and see the total cost.
3. The program should handle invalid inputs gracefully.

### Example:
```python
Welcome to the Pizza Ordering System!
Pizza Sizes and Prices:
1. Small: $8.00
2. Medium: $10.00
3. Large: $12.00
Please enter your name: Mr Jamieson
Please choose a pizza size (small, medium, large): small

Order Summary:
Name: Mr Jamieson
Pizza Size: Small
Total Cost: $8.00
```

### Additional Challenge (Optional):
- Add functionality to allow the user to order multiple pizzas and calculate the total cost.
- Include options for additional toppings with corresponding prices.
